# Spotify-App-

The Spotify App project is a Flask-based web application offering streamlined Spotify integration. Users authenticate securely, obtaining access tokens for their Spotify accounts. The app's key features include managing "Discover Weekly" playlists – saving them to a playlist named "Saved Weekly" – and retrieving total saved tracks.

With playlist management, users seamlessly preserve their weekly discoveries, creating or using an existing "Saved Weekly" playlist. The app also enables users to retrieve a summary of all saved tracks, intelligently handling pagination for a comprehensive track count.

Built with Flask, the app ensures secure user sessions and utilizes Spotipy for Spotify API interactions. Debug mode is enabled for development, providing insights. Disable it in production for enhanced security and performance.
